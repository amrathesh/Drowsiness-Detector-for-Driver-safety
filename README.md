Driver Drowsiness detection by monitoring his  blink rate using IR sensors

This project provides an efficient, easy low, cost way to detect and alert the driver about drowsiness. It can be installed on any system easily with low space consumption.
## Methodology
* Detecting whether the driverâ€™s eye is open or close using IR sensor.
* Determining blink rate by collecting this data for a specific interval of time.
* Comparing the obtained blink rate with standard blink rate table.
* Alerting the driver or slowing down the car if blink rate is found greater than his normal blink rate using buzzer and LED.

## Future Scope
This project can be further upgraded with providing GPS tracker along with GSM module to provide the details of the driver and his location as soon after detection of any crash using crash detector.
Even the drivers can be provided with some entertainment options when there is detection of drowsiness.
By IoT we can interconnect most of advanced accident protection and danger identification systems to properly monitor.
